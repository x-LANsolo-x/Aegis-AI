  # SECTION 1: THE HOOK (45 seconds)
  # Purpose: Grab attention immediately with a real-world crisis scenario
  # ==========================================================================
  section_1_the_hook:
    duration: "45 seconds"
    title: "The $25 Million Wake-Up Call"
    
    opening_statement: |
      "In February 2024, a finance worker in Hong Kong transferred $25.6 MILLION 
      to criminals. Why? He attended a video call where his CFO and colleagues 
      instructed him to do so. Every person on that call was a deepfake. 
      AI-generated. Fake. And completely convincing."
    
    escalation_points:
      - point: "This is not science fiction. This happened 11 months ago."
      - point: "Voice cloning now takes 3 seconds of audio. Three. Seconds."
      - point: "95% of deepfakes are undetectable by humans."
      - point: "By 2027, AI-generated fraud will cost $40 BILLION annually."
    
    the_real_problem: |
      "But here's what keeps security experts awake at night: What happens when 
      a deepfaked military commander issues an order? When a fake emergency 
      broadcast causes panic? When a cloned voice authorizes a nuclear facility 
      access? In those moments, you have SECONDS to verify. No internet. 
      No cloud. No time. What do you do?"
    
    transition: |
      "We built the answer. This is Aegis-AI."
    
    delivery_tips:
      - "Pause after '$25.6 MILLION' for impact"
      - "Make eye contact when saying 'Every person on that call was a deepfake'"
      - "Lower voice for 'What do you do?' - create tension"
      - "Strong, confident voice for 'This is Aegis-AI'"

          "SYNTHETIC DETECTED. 94% confidence. Look at these indicators:
           - Pitch variation is unnaturally consistent - machines don't breathe
           - Spectral artifacts showing vocoder signatures

    title: "The Science Behind the Shield"
    
    opening: |
      "This isn't a prototype held together with duct tape. Let me show you 
      the engineering that makes Aegis-AI bulletproof."
    
    detection_methodology:
      title: "Multi-Signal Ensemble Detection"
      explanation: |
        "We don't rely on a single detector that attackers can fool. 
        Aegis-AI uses an ENSEMBLE of 6+ independent detection signals:"
      
      signals:
        - signal: "Pitch Trajectory Analysis"
          detail: "Human pitch varies 20-40Hz naturally. Synthesizers show unnatural consistency or impossible transitions."
          
        - signal: "Spectral Artifact Detection"
          detail: "Neural vocoders leave fingerprints - harmonic distortions, phase discontinuities, frequency band anomalies."
          
        - signal: "Temporal Consistency"
          detail: "AI generates frame-by-frame. Humans have continuous micro-variations. We detect the difference."
          
        - signal: "Breathing & Silence Analysis"
          detail: "Humans breathe. AI doesn't. We analyze silence segments for biological signatures."
          
        - signal: "Formant Naturalness"
          detail: "Human vocal tract creates specific resonance patterns. Synthesis deviates from anatomical constraints."
          
        - signal: "Microstructure Analysis"
          detail: "Jitter, shimmer, and harmonic-to-noise ratio - biological markers impossible to perfectly synthesize."

# ============================================================================
#                     ANTICIPATED Q&A (WITH KILLER ANSWERS)
# ============================================================================

anticipated_questions:
  
  technical_questions:
    
    - question: "How accurate is your detection?"
      answer: |
        "Our architecture targets <5% Equal Error Rate, which is the industry 
        standard for biometric systems. More importantly, we use ensemble 
        detection - 6+ independent signals that would ALL need to be fooled 
        simultaneously. No single-point-of-failure."
      confidence_booster: "We can discuss the specific signals if you'd like to go deeper."
    
    - question: "Can attackers bypass your detection?"
      answer: |
        "Security is a cat-and-mouse game - we don't claim perfection. But 
        our multi-signal approach means attackers must fool spectrogram analysis, 
        pitch tracking, temporal consistency, AND biological markers simultaneously. 
        That's exponentially harder than fooling a single detector. Plus, our 
        federated learning enables continuous model updates without compromising 
        user privacy."
      confidence_booster: "We've designed for adversarial robustness from day one."
    
    - question: "Why not just use cloud-based solutions?"
      answer: |
        "Three reasons: First, AVAILABILITY - military operations, disaster 
        response, remote locations have no internet. Second, LATENCY - cloud 
        round-trips add seconds when you need milliseconds. Third, PRIVACY - 
        sensitive audio of commanders, witnesses, or classified briefings 
        cannot leave the device. Period."
      confidence_booster: "Offline-first isn't a limitation - it's our core innovation."
    
    - question: "How do you handle noisy audio or low-quality recordings?"
      answer: |
        "Great question. We use Voice Activity Detection to isolate speech, 
        robust feature extraction that's noise-tolerant, and confidence 
        thresholding. If quality is too low for reliable detection, we 
        explicitly say so and recommend re-capture. Honest uncertainty is 
        better than false confidence."
    
    - question: "What's your model architecture?"
      answer: |
        "For audio: CNN-based spectrogram analysis combined with hand-crafted 
        acoustic features (pitch, MFCC, formants). For video: ResNet50 backbone 
        with temporal LSTM and facial landmark analysis. All models are 
        quantized to INT8 for edge deployment with minimal accuracy loss."
    
    - question: "How do you train without massive datasets?"
      answer: |
        "We leverage existing research datasets: ASVspoof for audio spoofing, 
        FakeAVCeleb and DFDC for video deepfakes. Transfer learning from 
        pre-trained models reduces data requirements. And our federated 
        learning approach allows continuous improvement from real-world 
        deployment without centralizing sensitive data."
  
  business_questions:
    
    - question: "Who are your competitors?"
      answer: |
        "Microsoft, Pindrop, Resemble AI, and several startups offer deepfake 
        detection. But EVERY single one requires cloud connectivity. We're 
        the only solution that works offline, on-device, with zero data 
        exfiltration. For defense, law enforcement, and high-security 
        enterprise - that's not a feature, it's a requirement."
    
    - question: "How will you make money?"
      answer: |
        "Three revenue streams: Per-device licensing for government/defense 
        at $500-2000/device/year. Enterprise subscriptions for financial 
        institutions and media companies at $10K-100K/year. And API access 
        for developers. Our initial focus is defense pilots - that's where 
        the pain is acute and budgets exist."
    
    - question: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"
      answer: |
        "Land-and-expand with defense and law enforcement. We start with 
        pilot programs - prove value in controlled deployments. Success 
        stories become case studies for enterprise sales. The defense sector 
        is relationship-driven, so we're building those connections now."
    
    - question: "How big is this market?"
      answer: |
        "AI-generated fraud will cost $40 billion annually by 2027 according 
        to Deloitte. The deepfake detection market specifically is projected 
        at $8.5 billion by 2030 with 41.5% CAGR. And we're targeting the 
        segment with the highest willingness to pay: defense and high-security 
        enterprise."
  
  product_questions:
    
    - question: "Is this just a demo or a real product?"
      answer: |
        "Today, you're seeing a functional localhost demo and a complete UI 
        prototype. The detection logic works. The forensic reporting works. 
        What we need next is: full model training on production datasets, 
        mobile deployment optimization, and pilot program partnerships. 
        The architecture is production-ready - we need resources to scale."
    
    - question: "How long until this is production-ready?"
      answer: |
        "With dedicated focus: 3-4 months for audio detection MVP with full 
        model training. 6 months for video integration. 9 months for 
        enterprise-ready deployment with all three media types. We've 
        de-risked the architecture - now it's execution."
    
    - question: "Why should we believe you can build this?"
      answer: |
        "Look at what we built in [X] hours: Working detection demo, complete 
        UI prototype, forensic reporting, multi-signal analysis architecture. 
        We understand the ML problem, the deployment constraints, and the 
        user needs. We're not promising magic - we're showing progress."
  
  challenging_questions:
    
    - question: "What if deepfakes get too good to detect?"
      answer: |
        "Two responses: First, detection and generation are in an arms race, 
        but detection has inherent advantages - we can analyze at the signal 
        level while generators must fool multiple independent signals. Second, 
        even if detection becomes probabilistic, providing confidence scores 
        and evidence is still valuable. 'This might be fake, here's why' is 
        better than no information at all."
    
    - question: "Why would someone trust an AI to detect AI?"
      answer: |
        "That's exactly why we built EXPLAINABLE detection. We don't just 
        output 'fake' - we show the evidence. Spectral anomalies you can see. 
        Pitch patterns you can verify. The user makes the final decision; 
        we provide the analysis. Trust through transparency."
    
    - question: "Isn't offline-only a limitation?"
      answer: |
        "For our target users, it's the opposite - it's a requirement. A 
        soldier in the field, a disaster responder, an air-gapped government 
        system - they CAN'T use cloud solutions. We're not offline because 
        we couldn't build cloud. We're offline because that's what the 
        mission demands."

  flexibility_notes: |
    If running short on time, compress Technical Depth and Market sections.
    NEVER rush the Hook, Demo, or Close - these are your impact moments.
    
    If you have extra time, expand the Demo with more explanation or add
    a brief "future vision" section before the Close.
