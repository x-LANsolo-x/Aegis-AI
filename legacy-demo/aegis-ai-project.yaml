# PROBLEM STATEMENT
# ============================================================================
problem_statement:
  summary: |
    Deepfake audio and video can impersonate high-value targets including 
    Army Commanders, Police Officials, Politicians, CEOs, and Journalists.
    A single fake command can cause national-level damage.

  critical_scenario:
    description: |
      A field officer receives a voice note from a "senior officer" ordering 
      troop movement. The voice sounds real — but it is AI-generated.
    challenges:
      - "No internet connectivity in field operations"
      - "No time to verify authenticity"
      - "No trusted verification tool available"
      - "High stakes - wrong decision can be catastrophic"

  affected_stakeholders:
    - stakeholder: "Military Personnel"
      impact: "False orders leading to strategic failures"
      severity: "Critical"
    - stakeholder: "Law Enforcement"
      impact: "Manipulated evidence, wrong operations"
      severity: "High"
    - stakeholder: "Government Officials"
      impact: "Political misinformation, policy manipulation"
      severity: "High"
    - stakeholder: "Journalists"
      impact: "Spreading fake news unknowingly"
      severity: "Medium"
    - stakeholder: "General Public"
      impact: "Election manipulation, financial fraud"
      severity: "High"

# PROPOSED SOLUTION
# ============================================================================
proposed_solution:
  product_name: "AegisAI-Edge"
  tagline: "AI verification agent that works offline, on-device, in real-time"
  
  overview: |
    AegisAI-Edge is an AI verification agent that runs directly on field devices 
    (phones, body-cams, tactical hardware), works completely offline without 
    internet, provides instant results in 1-2 seconds, and uses federated 
    learning to continuously improve across all devices.
